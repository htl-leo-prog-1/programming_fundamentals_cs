<div class="container" data-markdown><div class="col" data-markdown>

* You regularly participate in a particular type of Geocaching challenge.
  * In those challenges, you start at a particular point and you get a list of movements.
  * You recognize that the creators of the Geocaching challenge have made a mistake by giving you all the movements at the beginning.
  * You can simply calculate the end point and go directly to it without actually doing all the movements.
* Specification for the exercise is available on GitHub:
  * [English](https://github.com/htl-leo-prog-1/programming_fundamentals_cs/blob/main/exams/2022-11-07-geo-caching/readme.md)
